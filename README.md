# EducationTutorForEngineeringStudents Customized LLM APP

This README provides a comprehensive guide to help you create and deploy a customized LLM Chatbot for engineering students using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), Gradio, and Hugging Face APIs. Follow these steps to build and deploy your chatbot efficiently and for free.

## Building a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Bot

Creating a RAG bot can greatly enhance the performance of a language model by incorporating external knowledge to generate more accurate and contextually relevant responses. This guide will help you build a simple RAG bot tailored for engineering students.

### How Does RAG Enhance LLM Performance?

RAG improves language model performance by augmenting it with external documents. This method retrieves relevant documents based on the user's query and combines them with the original prompt before passing them to the language model. This ensures the model has access to up-to-date and domain-specific information without extensive retraining.

### Basic Steps in RAG

1. **Input**: The user's question is the input to which the LLM responds. Without RAG, the LLM responds directly to the question.

2. **Indexing**: When using RAG, related documents are indexed by chunking them, generating embeddings of the chunks, and indexing them into a vector store. At inference, the query is also embedded similarly.

3. **Retrieval**: Relevant documents are obtained by comparing the query against the indexed vectors, resulting in "Relevant Documents."

4. **Generation**: Relevant documents are combined with the original prompt as additional context. The combined text and prompt are passed to the model for response generation, which is then provided to the user.

### Example of RAG Enhancing LLM Performance

Without RAG, the model might not respond accurately to questions due to a lack of current knowledge. With RAG, the system can retrieve relevant information needed for the model to answer questions appropriately.

### Requirements

- A PDF containing your knowledgebase.
- A `requirements.txt` file listing dependencies.
- An `app.py` file with the application code.
- A Hugging Face account. [Sign up here](https://huggingface.co/join).

### Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Prepare Your Knowledgebase**
   - Gather and structure your knowledgebase in a PDF file. This file will contain the essential information and study materials for engineering students.

2. **Create the `requirements.txt` File**
   - List all dependencies required for your project. Example:
     ```txt
     transformers
     gradio
     sentence-transformers
     ```

3. **Develop the `app.py` File**
   - This file contains the code to build and run your RAG chatbot. Here's a basic template:
     ```python
     import gradio as gr
     from transformers import pipeline
     from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer, util

     # Load models
     llm_model = pipeline("text-generation", model="Zephyr-7B")
     embedder = SentenceTransformer('all-MiniLM-L6-v2')

     # Load and index knowledgebase
     knowledgebase = "path/to/your/knowledgebase.pdf"
     # Implement PDF loading and indexing logic here

     def rag_response(query):
         # Implement retrieval and generation logic here
         return response

     # Gradio Interface
     iface = gr.Interface(fn=rag_response, inputs="text", outputs="text")
     iface.launch()
     ```

4. **Deploy on Hugging Face Spaces**
   - Log into your Hugging Face account and navigate to [Spaces](https://huggingface.co/spaces).
   - Create a new Space and upload your `app.py`, `requirements.txt`, and the knowledgebase PDF.
   - Click on 'Create' to deploy your chatbot.

### Customization Example

To make your chatbot more useful for engineering students, personalize it:

- Modify system messages to include technical explanations and resource suggestions.
- Program the chatbot to provide study materials, solve engineering problems, and offer exam tips.

Experiment with different roles and instructions to fully utilize your chatbot's capabilities. Share your creations and experiences to inspire others.
